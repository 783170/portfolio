            My name is Erin De Witt, and I am a junior at the University of St. Thomas pursuing my double major in
            Computer
            Science and Computer Engineering with minors in Statistics, Data Analytics, and Philosophy. Welcome to my
            portfolio website! I built this website based on the original portfolio website I created in high school.
            The goal of this version was to update the overall design and content to reflect what I have been doing
            since I started college. <br><br>
            I started making this new version at the start of September 2024 and am hoping to finish updating the content by the end of October!
