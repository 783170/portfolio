            Hi, my name is Erin De Witt!
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.5vw">
            I am a junior at the University of St. Thomas earning my double major in computer science and computer engineering. This summer I had the pleasure of working as a full-stack software engineering intern at Medtronic. I have a passion for learning, and I am excieted to continue to explore the different areas of software development. I am currently looking for a Spring 2025 internship working in computer science, computer engineering, or data analytics. <br><br>
            As a board member of the St. Thomas chapter of SWE, at the end of October I will get to attend the SWE confrence in Chicago. This will be my first time attending the SWE confrence since starting college. I am excited for the opportunity to grow as an engineer and continue to meet other female engineers. This January I will be studying abroad in Seoul, South Korea. I will be taking an engineering course called "High-Tech Manufacturing, Engineering, and Society". I will get the opportunity to tour six different manufacturing locations in South Korea, including Hyundai and HP. <br><br>
            As the president of the St. Thomas chapter of IEEE, I am working to improve the chapter for current and future students. I am working to build more relationships with alumni and engineers local to the area. I am working with the board to host more events each semester that higher quality events. If you or your company would like to be a part of an event feel free to reach out to me!
